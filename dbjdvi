Build a contact management module:

1) Create an array of contact objects with properties like name, phone, email, and a method to

display contact info

2) Use destructuring to extract contact info inside methods and other functions

3) Access contact properties using both dot and bracket notation Iterate through the array of contacts to print all contact details

4) Use the rest parameters to create a function that adds multiple contacts at once

5) Use the spread operator to merge multiple contact arrays

Demonstrate call(), apply(), and bind() by borrowing a display method from one object to another
